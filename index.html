        <div id="tribute-info">
          "Tribute" was written as a paean to the impossibility of reaching
          musical perfection.

              <span>"Tribute"</span> was released on February 11, 2002, in the
              United States and on June 24, 2002, in Australia.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>"Tribute"</span> is a song by American comedy rock duo
              Tenacious D, and the second single from their self-titled debut
              album (2001).
            </p>
            <p>
              The song is a <span>"Tribute"</span> to what Kyle Gass and Jack
              Black refer to as "The Greatest Song in the World" (often confused
              as the song's title).
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>"Tribute"</span> was the first song Black and Gass played
              live as Tenacious D. The song, like many other songs that were
              recorded on Tenacious D, was originally performed on their
              short-lived HBO TV series.

            JB: That’s true.<br />
            KG: Jack played it for me once…<br />
            JB: I turned it on… turned Kyle onto it and I said, “I think they’re
            the best band in the world. Metallica. And I think this song is the
            best song in the world.” And then Kyle agreed after he listened to
            it thrice. At first he said nay. Then he said perhaps. And then he
            said yeah."
